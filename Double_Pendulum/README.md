Computational Physics projects which examines the dynamics of the single and double pendulum as well as the numerical stability of the various methods used.

Code files include:

* sing_pend.py which contains the single pendulum class
* doub_pend.py which contains the double pendulum class
* main.py which contains the plotting functions

The user can reproduce all figures and the table of the report by the functions under # MAIN RUNS # in main.py.
All three modules contain documentation to help the user explore them.
