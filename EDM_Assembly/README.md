Computational Physics project which investigates the numerical solution to 2D Laplace equation on rectangular electric plate assemblies. The methods used are Jacobi iteration and Successive Over-relaxation which are compared for convergence speed as well.

Code files include:

* base_class.py
* square_cable.py
* edm.py
* main.py

All modules need to be in the same folder to run.
The first three contain classes.
Module main.py contains an executable line which produces any figure in the report.
There is documentation in all the modules to help the user explore them.
